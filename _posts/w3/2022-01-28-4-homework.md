## Part 2: Tile design 
Task overview: Write code to generate a 2D [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile) pattern that could be used for wallpaper or fabric design.  
- A tile is a rectangular design that can be indefinitely repeated and extended. 
	- e.g., using the same tile design, you can make a painting with 1000 x 1000 cells, or 15 x 12 cells. 
- Design something you would want to put on your walls or you would want to wear. We might have a class-wide exhibition for this assignment. 

###  Task 2.1, sketches 
Look for inspirations online (search for wallpaper/fabric design), and make at least **3**  sketches (manually, or with your ipad/phone/computer, do not code it). Your designs need to follow these rules: 
1. It should be rectangular. There are tiling works with non-rectangular shapes ([e.g., this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg), and [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dirry_hexagon_tile_at_a_DC_Subway_stop.jpg)), but in this assignment, please stick with rectangular tiles like [this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) or [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg). 
2. It should have more than 2 colors 
	1. e.g., black + white + gray is fine
3. It's designed for repetition. You are designing one tile to be repeated across your entire wall ([like this example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Decorative_tiles#/media/File:Geometria.jpg)) instead of desgining many unique tiles ([like this example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile#/media/File:Ganshoren_avenue_Broustin_10_1002.jpg).) 


What you design is up to you, but here are several suggestions: 

1.  Give consideration to aesthetics of your design. Think about symmetry, rhyme, color, and balance. 
2. Think about how you are tiling your designs. 
	1. Your tile needs to be rectangular, but doesn't need to be a square. e.g., [long tile](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wall_tiles#/media/File:Azabujuban_station_Oedo_platform_wall_tiles.jpg)
	2. Think about which angle works the best for your design. e.g., [45](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Garden_Tiles_(7433823224).jpg) vs. [90](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_and_white_Tiles_0027.jpg)?
	3. You don't have to tile them in a spreadsheet-like grid. e.g., [long tiles](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herringbone_bond.svg) 
3.  I recommend start simple. Use many straight lines. If you are designing [an elaborate floral pattern](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wall_paper_Belville.png) , it might be difficult for you to implement at this stage. It's still good to sketch it down, but I recommend saving these sketches for later. 

**When you finish the sketch, take a picture of it and paste your sketches to your answer sheet.** 

### Task 2.2 turn your sketch into code <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 1.5%  </span>
Write a script to implement one of your sketches using the [turtle graphics package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). 
- After implementing it, run and take a screenshot of the final output. Paste the screenshot to the answer sheet. 
- It's ok if your generated output looks slightly different from your sketch
- BONUS opportunity (<span style="color:#0000ff;">0.1% bonus </span>):  Write a paragraph about your design. In the paragraph, includes  
	- The name of your design 
	- Description of your design
	- Inspiration for your design. 
	- Challenges encountered in implementing your design. 

Save your script as `hw2_part2.py`

Tips: 
- The turtle documentation page is your friend. https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html.  Don't limit yourself to functions that we covered in class.
