### Step 2: Install Pycharm

PyCharm is a code editor for Python. You can edit Python files with almost any editor (e.g., text editor). However, a specialized editor like PyCharm can help you to check syntax and organize your code easily. 

If you have other editors you prefer to use, you are not required to swith to PyCharm. However, we will use PyCharm in our demo and lectures. 

To install PyCharm, you have the following two options: 
1. Install the [professional version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ You will have educational license, which you can obtain from [this website](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 
2. You can download the [community version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) which is an open-source version. 

*After installing PyCharm (or other IDE you prefer), complete the following task:* 

1. Create a new folder called "lab1" in your course folder. e.g., make   `C:\licia\course\VIST270\lab1\`. 
2. Create a python file called `lab1.py`
