##  Agenda 
1. Introduction 
2. Installation 


## Installation List 
1. Python  (version 3+)
2. Code Editor (PyCharm)
3. Maya 
4. (Optional) Source Control 


### Step 1: Install Python 

You have 2 installation options 
1. Install [Anaconda (Recommended)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Install [Python 3 only] (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

*After installing this, please complete the following task* 
1. Open your terminal. 
	1. If you are on windows, and you installed Anaconda, please open *Anaconda Prompt*. If you only installed python only, please open your *command prompt*.

	2. If you are on Mac, open your *terminal*.   


2. Navigate to a folder where you would like to store your VIST 270 course content by using the ["cd" command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command). 
	1. e.g., I want to store all of my  `C:\licia\course\VIST270\`. 
	2. I would first make sure the VIST270 folder exist. Create this folder first. 
	3.  In my command prompt, I would type `cd C:\licia\course\VIST270\`
	4. After typing that command, my command prompt should show that

3.  In your command prompt, type `python`. You should see something similar to this

	1. If this gives you error. Here are a few possibilities: 
		1. You installed python3 only, try typing `python3` 
		2. There might be an issue with your installation. Try installing again, and asking us for help. 

4. Find out the value of 2435 times 11345. 
	1. the star symbol * is the multiply operator in Python. e.g. if you type `1*3`, you will see

	3. If you see 27625075 on your screen, congrats! Type `quit()` to exit python. 


### Step 2: Install Pycharm

PyCharm is a code editor for Python. You can edit Python files with almost any editor (e.g., text editor). However, a specialized editor like PyCharm can help you to check syntax and organize your code easily. 

If you have other editors you prefer to use, you are not required to swith to PyCharm. However, we will use PyCharm in our demo and lectures. 

To install PyCharm, you have the following two options: 
1. Install the [professional version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ You will have educational license, which you can obtain from [this website](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). 
2. You can download the [community version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) which is an open-source version. 

*After installing PyCharm (or other IDE you prefer), complete the following task:* 

1. Create a new folder called "lab1" in your course folder. 
	1. e.g., make   `C:\licia\course\VIST270\Spring2022\lab1\`. 
2. Create a python file called `lab1.py`
	1.    ![](../../../assets/w1/270week1-02.png)
3.  Write the "hello world " statement in your PyCharm Editor in Lab 1
	1. `print("Hello World!")`
	2.  ![](../../../assets/w1/Pasted image 20220111144112.png)
4. In your command prompt, navigate to the folder that contains the lab1.py 
	1. Use the command `cd`  to go to a directory 
	2. If you need to go to the parent directory, use `cd ../` 
	3. If you want to check what's inside of a directory 
		1. use `dir` if you use windows, 
		2. or `ls` if you use Mac. 
		3.  ![](../../../assets/w1/270week1-03.png)

	2.  Run the lab1 script by typing `python lab1.py` . If you used `python3` instead of `python` in the previous step, you should run `python3` here as well.

		2. If you see `Hello World` on your command prompt, congrats!



  ## Install Maya 


1. Download and install Autodesk Maya 2022. If you have Maya installed, please make sure it is Maya 2022 because version prior to 2020 supports python 2 instead of python 3.  
	1. - you can select the educational version by providing your user id. Make an autodesk account and [apply for the education license](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&page=1)
	2.  or you can download a 30-day free trial while you wait for your id to be approved. To download trial, [go to this link](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/free-trial?support=ADVANCED&plc=MAYA&term=1-YEAR&quantity=1)  You will need to select "bussiness" in order to download.

## Learn and install a version control software (Optional)

Version control will make your programming life easier. 

It is optional for this class, but I highly recommend you learn about git. You can find plenty of tutorials/reading on this topic online. If you do not want to use command prompt/terminals for version control, you can also find tools with interfaces, such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
