## Part 1: Maya Cube Coloring[(partially covered in lab)]():  <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 3%  </span>

**Overview:** We are going to build a rubik's cube in Maya today. [Rubik's Cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube) are classical puzzle toys that are made of cubes. In this lab we will build a static ribuk's cube.

## Task 1.1 Making and coloring a cube. <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
Before making a rubik's cube, let's make one polyCube and color it according the rubik's cube rule. 

A standard 3x3 rubik's cube has 6 colors: Assuming the top side is white and the front side is blue, the color arrangement is as follows:
- Front: Blue, Back: Green
- Top: White, Bottom: Yellow
- Left: Red, Right: Orange 

You can check [this online guide for the setup](https://www.rubiks.com/en-uk/rubiks-cube-3x3-guide)

Maya set up color using rgb percentages. Therefore, the colors can be stored in a format similar to this: 

```
color_list=[(0,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,1,0),(1,1,0),(1,0.4,0),(1,0,0)]  
color_keys=["B","W","G","Y","O","R"]
```

Task: Make a 10 x 10 cube that is colored according to the rubik's cube.

Hint: 
1. You will need to create shaders. I recommend using lambert (flat, matte shader). 
2. You will need to select individual faces. 
	1. To select, use `<object_name>.f[<idx>]`.  `<object_name>` is the name of the cube. By default, it's *pCube1*. `f` stands for *face* here. The variable `<idx>` is the index of the face. 
	2. A cube has 6 faces, indexed in the following order: [Front, Top, Back, Bottom, Right, Left]
3. You can add shade using the method `hyperShade(shader)` . `shader` here is the variable that stores your shader. 


### Task 1.2 Making a colored Rubik's cube <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>
The simplest way to produce a colored rubik's cube is to repeat task one 3 times in each direction. Develop a function that generate a design similar to this :

### Task 1.3 Make a more accurately colored rubik's cube <span style="color:#0000ff;"> 0.5%  </span>

In real manufacturing process, sides that are hidden will not get colored. e.g., the top two rows should not be colored blue in an actual cube, because these sides will never be visible.

Write a function that generate the more accurately colored rubik's cube. 
The outside looks very similar to the previous task.

However, the non-visible sides should not get color

### Task 1.4 Make Patterned Cubes

Rubik's cubes can make beautiful patterns. In this task, write function to generate 5 different pattern designs by altering the color. You can look for inspirations on this site:
