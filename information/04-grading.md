## Reading and Quiz
This class use a [flipped classroom model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom#:~:text=A%20flipped%20classroom%20is%20an,problem%2Dsolving%20during%20class%20time.), where you will learn the core concepts through readings and online lecture watching. After the reading/online lecture, you should be able to complete the homework set. <strong>It is crucial for you to complete these readings/videos BEFORE your lab sessions </strong>. All reading materials will be released on or before the Friday prior to the new week. On the following Monday, a quiz regarding the reading material will due at <strong>10 pm (instead of midnight)</strong>.   

You will complete all quizzes electronically on Canvas. You will receive immediate feedback as to the correctness of answers. You may repeat questions that they do not get correct. 



## Homework  
Each homework set will contain 3 different sections: 
1. Pure Python Section 
2. Maya Section 
3. Bonus Challenges 


For each section, you will write script in one python script file and submit them. e.g., you will submit the following file for HW1
-   hw1_p.py
- hw1_m.py
- hw1_b.py  (OPTIONAL)


In addition to producing these scripts, we also ask you to complete an answersheet each week. The answer sheet is simple document where you will write responses and paste screenshots for the output of your program.  You will complete the document, export it into PDF, and upload to Canvas along with your scripts. 

Therefore, for each homework set, you will upload 3 files (4 if you have completed the bonus challenge) to Canvas.  
- hw1_p.py
- hw1_m.py
- hw1_b.py (OPTIONAL)
- hw1_answer_sheet.pdf

Homework sets will be released on Friday. They are due the next Sunday at <strong>10 pm (instead of midnight)</strong>. We will try to grade as soon as we can.  Please allow 1-2 weeks to receive the grading.
